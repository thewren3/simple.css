				<h2>About</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>The Upper Valley Running Segment Challenge is based off of a <a href="https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2025-01-02-CHIPOTLE-X-STRAVA-PARTNERSHIP-GOES-GLOBAL-INTRODUCING-THE-CITY-CHALLENGE-IN-25-MARKETS-TO-KICK-OFF-2025">similar challenge</a> that happened in January, where runners in different cities competed against each other by running a specific “segment” as many times as possible. You can read more about this challenge  <a href="https://run.outsideonline.com/general/free-burrito-running-challenge/">here</a> – it was very fun to follow along! I thought that this challenge would be fun to bring to the upper valley as it rewards distance and time on feet, not as much speed, which is a fun twist on racing. 
					<br>
					<br>
					For our Upper Valley edition, we will adapt the rules a little to encourage wider participation. But the gist of the competition is: <strong>every segment completion nets you 1 point. Whoever has the most points at the end of the competition wins.</strong>
					<br>
					<br>
					Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate! You do not need to have Strava; all you have to have is some way of tracking your run (Garmin, nikerun, apple, coros, etc.)  </p>

				<h2>The Segments</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>There are 4 segments in the challenge, designed as such to maximize accessibility. All of these segments count for the same, which means that each of these, when completed, count for 1 point.</p>
				
				<div class="segment">
					<h3>Segment 1: <a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/Segment?id=2410926">Pine Park mini loop</a> </h3>
					<h3>Segment 2: <a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/Segment?id=24421529">Beaver Meadow Sprint</a> </h3>
					<h3>Segment 3: <a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/Segment?id=9292617">Rail Trail, Covered Bridge to Pool</a> </h3>
					<h3>Segment 4: <a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/Segment?id=27365741">Hartford Ave to Watson Park</a> </h3>

				<h2>Rules</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<h3>Competition Guidelines:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Segments are only one direction. There is an established start point, and an established finish point. So if you complete a segment and then run that segment back the way you came, this would still only count as one segment completion. </li>
					<br>
					<li>One segment completion equals one point. You may complete a segment as many times as you want within a run (and thus you can net multiple points all within one run). You may also complete multiple segments in one run.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Segment completions must be done on foot. No vehicle assistance allowed.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Segment completions have to be proven; to prove you’ve finished a segment, you can either submit a link to the strava/garmin/coros activity, or link to a shared google doc with a picture/screenshot of the run details. Docs should be shared with uppervalleyrunningsegment@gmail.com </li>
					<br>
					<li>Segment completions should be submitted within 5 days of completion. In the last week, May 24th-May 31st, submissions should be within 24 hours of completion.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Anyone and everyone is welcome to participate! Spread the word to your friends, family, and neighbors!</li>
					<br>
					<li>This challenge’s time frame is from May 1st to May 31st, 11:59pm</li>
